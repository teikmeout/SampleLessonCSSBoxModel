## Content
### HTML elements
As simple as that, ANY HTML element = BOX, that simple.  
HTML elements can be [**Inline**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements) or [**Block**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements) elements. We are going to focus on the block elements.  

### Brief Introduction: Height and width 
When the box is empty, it's collapsed

**Let's head over to our index.html!!**  
Let's try adding `background-color: firebrick` in the body `<body>` tag, like this:  
```css
body {
    background-color: firebrick;
}
```

Why don't we see red in the page right now? ðŸ˜« ðŸ˜© ðŸ˜¤
> If body has no content or no defined height it will not show red at all. Same goes for any block element: it's collapsed  

By adding content we can make the box appear in the HTML page...

```css
body {
    background-color: firebrick;
    height: 100%;
}
```

### The four properties of the box-model  
![](https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/webd2/student/unit3/images/boxmodel.gif)  

*Margin* - most exterior space around the HTML object, it's like the force, it pushes our box away from others.  
*Border* - delimits the surroundings, like a fence. The fence **has thickness too!**  
*Padding* - the filling between our content and the border.  
*Content* - Whatever we put inside of this box.  

We can modify the values of these by tagetting our div...  
```css
div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    /*with no height and width our div would not appear*/
    margin: 100px 100px 100px 100px;
    border: 20px solid black;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

**The order for these values in CSS**  
TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT  
`margin: 100px 100px 100px 10px`  

## Sidewalk, Fence, Garden, House example... To the whiteboard!
IMPORTANT: when you add values to each one of these they will SUM UP as part of the perimeter of the whole element (read, the bigger our values, the more garden, fence and sidewalk we are going to have). 

## Let's do some exercises
Look into `index.html` file and let's start styling:
1. Make a div, with a fancy border  
2. Give me the dimmensions considering thickness of the box-model  

## Wrap up 
What did we learn?
1. CSS height (and why it's important)
2. CSS width
3. CSS Box Model
